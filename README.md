# chatbox_project
a chatbox that has different game options 
This project is a simple desktop application written in Python using the Tkinter library. It was created for learning purposes by students who wanted to improve their skills in GUI programming, game development, and basic user interaction.

The program works like a small game hub. When you open the app, you see a chatbox on one side and a menu with buttons on the other side. The user can type messages in the chat area to get simple answers about jokes, fun facts, movies, books, and TV shows. The chatbot is not advanced, but it can give short, friendly replies based on keywords.

The main feature of the program is the collection of mini-games. These games are fully playable and can be switched using the menu buttons. The available games include:
	•	UNO: A simplified version of the classic card game. The player competes against two CPU opponents. The game handles drawing cards, turns, colors, and special cards like “Skip” and “Draw Two”.
	•	Trivia Quiz: A short quiz game with 10 random questions. The player types answers into a box, and the game checks if the answer is close enough to the correct one.
	•	Snake: A basic snake game where the snake moves around the screen, eats food, and grows longer. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
	•	Connect Four: A two-player or vs-computer game where players drop colored discs into columns, trying to connect four in a row.
	•	Tic Tac Toe: A classic 3x3 game with a mode to play against another player or against the computer. The computer uses a simple AI to make decisions.

Each game runs in its own frame, and only one game is active at a time. The chat and games are combined in the same window for an interactive experience.

We made this project to explore how to combine different Python skills into a single application. It helped us learn how to use event-driven programming, work with graphical interfaces, and build basic game logic. The code may not be perfect, but it was a fun and useful learning experience.

Warning: When the application first opens, the interface might not display correctly. To fix this, please click on the buttons in the following order: Chat, Trivia, Connect Four, Tic Tac Toe, UNO, and Help. This will properly load and reset the layout.
